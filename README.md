*Tech Quiz Challenge* is a lightweight, fully responsive JavaScript-based quiz application designed to help users test and improve their technical knowledge. With instant feedback, auto-advancing questions, and a visually engaging results interface, this project is perfect for quick knowledge checks, coding interview preparation, or simply sharpening your skills in programming and technology.

The primary goal of this application is to provide a user-friendly environment where learners can focus on answering questions and tracking their performance without the distraction of complex UI elements or unnecessary dependencies. Built entirely using vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3, the project is lightweight and does not require any external libraries or frameworks, ensuring fast loading times and easy deployment.

## Key Features

- ‚úÖ *Seamless Auto-Advance*: Questions automatically move to the next one after a short interval (default 2 seconds). This feature allows learners to stay focused on answering without the need to manually click ‚ÄúNext,‚Äù creating a smooth and continuous quiz experience.  
- ‚úÖ *Instant Feedback*: Each answer selection immediately provides visual feedback, indicating whether the chosen option is correct or incorrect. Correct answers are highlighted, helping users learn in real-time.  
- ‚úÖ *Smart Analytics & Results*: After completing the quiz, users can see a detailed breakdown of their performance. The results include a circular percentage score, a review of each question with the correct answers, and an assessment of skill level based on overall accuracy.  
- ‚úÖ *Mobile-Ready Design*: The layout is fully responsive, making the quiz accessible on desktops, tablets, and smartphones. CSS Flexbox and Grid are used to ensure proper alignment and fluid design across all screen sizes.  
- ‚úÖ *Zero Dependencies*: No external libraries, frameworks, or plugins are required. Everything is built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making the project lightweight, easy to host, and simple to maintain.  
- ‚úÖ *Easy Customization*: Adding new questions or modifying existing ones is straightforward. Users only need to edit the questions array in script.js to customize the quiz content according to their learning goals or subject focus.
